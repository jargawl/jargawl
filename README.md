🔺 My commercial projects: 

📱 TripsyTrip 

Project Information:

I built a mobile application from scratch for planning trips. I delivered a very high grade of development for this project (clean code, architecture, making the app easy to test, maintain and add new features). The user is initially prompted to make an account, fill out basic personal information (such as age and hobbies), and upload some photos. Then, he can choose from a wide range of amazing excursions. The app can also recommend some trips that are appropriate for the age and interests of the trip participants. Users can participate in the Welcome conversation prior to the trip to get to know other travelers better and discuss the itinerary's attractions and activities. App adheres to the most recent animation and gesture standards for mobile applications.

Stack and Skills:

Flutter / Dart, BLoC (state management), Internalization, Firebase FireStore, Authentication (Google, AppStore, Facebook, PhoneNumber), Firebase Storage, App distribution to testers, Facebook integration, Pictures uploading, Notifications, Tests (unit tests and widget tests), User messages and group chats

📱 DPS-MWS (High Bay Warehouse) 

Project Information:

A mobile app offers every feature required for warehouse operations, including the ability to receive and distribute goods, print labels, scan barcodes, transfer stock, do inventory procedures, and more. The app is made to function effectively on both stock specialised scanning equipment (such a Zebra scanner) and typical mobile phones (scanning using camera). The project comprises not only the finished app for the user, but also the framework's preparation so that the customer, who is not a coder, can modify the app's design, content, and features before selling it to the user.

Stack and Skills:

Flutter / Dart, BLoC (state management), REST API, Barcode scanner, Labels printing using external Zebra printer, Saving data in device memory

🔹 My personal projects : 

📱 LifeView

Project Information: 

The LifeView app will allow you to stop for a moment and think about owning your life 👀. It's an emotional tracker that will let you think about what emotions you experience the most✍️. With LifeView you can think about what you are grateful for in your life ☀️, what your goals are 📈, and in the dreams section you can say out loud what you dream about 🚀🚀🚀! The application is constantly adding new technologies and features, however because I work as a Flutter Developer  I don't have a lot of time for side projects.

Stack and Skills:

Flutter / Dart, REST API, Get_it, Injecteable, Bloc/Cubit, Unit tests, Freezed, Dio, Retrofit, Firebase Database, Firebase Authentication


⚡ Fun fact: 

Sport has been a constant in my life. I spent more than 20 years swimming professionally before becoming a coach at a sports club I founded. I have always had a fascination with technology and programming. I made the decision to change my life one day and play sports as an amateur instead of a professional.
